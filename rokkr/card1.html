    <p>OnlyFans is a content-sharing platform, based in London. Creators can use it to offer videos, photos, and even chances to chat one-on-one for a price. It is popular in the adult entertainment industry. The New York Times even ran a story in early 2019 that claimed OnlyFans had changed sex work forever, dubbing OnlyFans &quot;the paywall of porn&quot;. But OnlyFans is used by all sorts of creators.</p>
    <p>OnlyFans was founded by Timothy Stokely and is a website only with no official apps. It currently has around 50 million users and 450,000 creators.</p>

    <p>Models, musicians, actors, physical fitness experts, and influencers all use OnlyFans to generate revenue. They can receive money directly from fans on a monthly basis or from tips and the pay-per-view feature. Blac Chyna, for instance, charges fans $50 a month to access her OnlyFans page, and rapper Rubi Rose made $100,000 on OnlyFans in two days by posting photos from her Instagram. Actress Bella Thorne also claimed to make more than $2 million on OnlyFans in one week.</p>
